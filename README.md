# 3D Printed Valve
A 3D printed valve is equipped with a membrane that opens or closes tubing based on how the membrane is oriented; functioning similarly to a CMOS transistor in an electrical circuit. This 3D printed soft fluidic valve can operate as an OR-gate, an AND-gate, or a NOT-gate.

This repository serves as a user guide for the 3D printable valve and covers various topics: 
* Fabrication and assembly guide
* Device characterization
* Demonstrations
* Tube extruding nozzle design
* Feedback for using the device as an educational tool

## Fabrication of body and caps
The 3D printed valve is categorized into two designs: mono- and bi-stable designs. We have uploaded the CAD files, STL files, and G-code profiles for the body and caps in the CAD folder of this repository.

Here is the video of 3D printing the body and caps on the Prusa Mk3S+ printer (https://youtu.be/z_FRGywTmZA)


## Fabrication of extuding tubing

This figure shows a 3D model of the tube-extruding printing nozzle, including a schematic and a cross-sectional view. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW0tsSzDVcI] is a video showing the tube-extruding in progress. We used a Prusa Mini+ FDM printer ($399) and the open-source Pronterface
software to control the printer. To extrude the tubes, we use G-code commands to configure the print parameters and initiate the tubing extrusion process. For Ninjaflex 85A filament, we set the nozzle temperature to 235 ◦C at 100% fan speed and extrude 1000 mm of filament. Here are the commands to extrude tubing. 
* G91			# relative positioning
* (G0 z10)		# test if relative positioning work
* M83			# relative extruder positioning
* M106 S255		# full fan speed
* M104 S235		# temperature to 235	# wait for temperature to reach 235
* g0 f150 e1000		# extrude 1000 mm of filament with speed of 150 	# 1000 is the max length that can be sent one time

## Alternative to extruded tubing
An off-the-shelf tubing(5236K203, McMaster-Carr, https://www.mcmaster.com/5236K203/) can also be used to fabricate the bistable device since the nozzle might not be available for purchase/fabrication.  


## Assembly of 3D printed valve 
Once you have all the components, we will investigate the assembly process. You will need the following tools for the assembly process (Figure 2A).
*	Flush cutter
*	Superglue
*	Twizers
*	Gloves
*	Vernier caliper
*	Custom 3D printed assembly tool

Please follow provided instructions for the assembly process of the 3D printed valve
1.	First, we will start with the cap and tubing. The tubes are extruded using a custom nozzle. Also, ensure to check for the thinner side of the tube and position the thicker side inwards to prevent easy kinking. Refer to Figure 2B, which illustrates an incorrect configuration where the thinner side of the tubing faces inward, leading to potential kinking issues. This step is especially important. It is one of the most common causes of failure. Feel free to throw away pieces of tubing that always kink by itself in any direction (Figure 2B).
2.	We use following tube lengths for the top and bottom side of the tubing.
*	Top: 11.5 mm + 1.5 mm spacer
*	Bottom: 8 mm
3. Before sticking the tubes, soften them by crushing it in different directions (kink every single part of tube, thus tube is less prone to kink by itself) (Figure 2B).

Figure 3 Top tube assembly process. A) Applying glue to the spacer of the top tubing B) Use the 3D printed tool to make sure that the tube is perfectly perpendicular and C) applying slight pressure to stick spacer to the membrane

4.	First, we will start inserting the top tube through the holes of top cap. Make sure the distance for the top tube is 11.5 mm and bottom tube is 8 mm. Please measure the distance using vernier caliper (Figure 2C). The 1 mm spacer is the part of the tube, cut 1.5 mm piece and attach to the tubing as shown. Apply glue to top of tube and stick to the spacer (Figure 2D).
5.	Write down length of tube at the bottom of cap (write “8” or “11.5+1.5”). When glue is dried, start assembling the cap to the body.
6.	Apply half a drop / a drop of glue to top of spacer. With help of the printed tool, slightly press the spacer at the center of membrane (Figure 3A and 3B).
7.	Make sure that the tube is perfectly perpendicular to the holes on membrane body (all three lines in Figure 3B are perpendicular to each other) (Figure 3C). When glue dries, start to glue top cap to the body.
8.	Make sure to protect your hands with glues in this step. Put lots of glue around the cap and push the cap inside body. Glue should overflow, and it will help seal the parts.
9.	For better gluing, better to apply some glue to top surface of the cap (Figure 4A). This will make cap stick to body from the inside.
10.	Follow the same procedure for the bottom tube, here you will not need any spacer and no need to glue the bottom tubing to the membrane.
11.	Put some clamps from both side of the cap to hold the three parts together (Figure 4B and 4C). Start with the cap without forces from membrane, which is bottom cap. This way it’s easier. It’s fine to destroy some gloves at this point.

Figure 4. Complete valve assembly process. A) Applying glue to  the cap for gluing to body B) Putting both the bottom and top cap together and C) using clamps D) Test the device to confirm that it is not leaking and correctly kinking. 

12.	Also, don’t apply too much pressure when sticking them together. Having a lot of glue between cap and body makes a very robust seal and helps the structure retain high pressure. It’s encouraged to apply more glue to ensure air-tightness. This is the final chance to fix non-perpendicular problem. Make sure to make it perpendicular.
13.	Once you have the valve entirely assembled, please check for the airtightness (Figure 4D).
14.	Configure the valve to NOT gate and check if you are able to obtain that behavior.
15.	Configuration process (First for the testing purpose, you will configure the device into NOT gate. You will include the truth table of the device in the lab report. Also, you will configure the device into AND gate and OR gate, include the truth table for the configurations.)
